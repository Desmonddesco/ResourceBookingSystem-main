# üßæ Internal Resource Booking System  
**Created by:** Mushiana Desmond  
**Role:** Junior ASP.NET Core Developer  
**Project Type:** Technical Assessment Case Study  

---

## üìå Objective

To build a simple yet functional internal web application that allows employees to view available shared resources (e.g., meeting rooms, company cars, or equipment) and book them for specific time slots ‚Äî eliminating double bookings and confusion.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Overview (Per Case Study)

### üîπ 1. Project Setup
- Created new ASP.NET Core **MVC** project using `.NET 8.0`.
- Configured **Entity Framework Core** with MYSQL WORKBENCH.
- Connection string stored in `appsettings.json`.
- Registered DbContext using `services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>()`.

---

### üîπ 2. Resource Management
- **Model**: `Resource.cs` with properties:  
  `Id`, `Name`, `Description`, `Location`, `Capacity`, `IsAvailable`
- **DbContext**: Registered `DbSet<Resource>` in `ApplicationDbContext.cs`
- **Migrations**:
  - Created and applied using `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate` and `dotnet ef database update`
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Fully implemented: Create, Read (Index + Details), Update, Delete
- **Validation**:
  - Applied `[Required]` and custom rules like positive `Capacity`

---

### üîπ 3. Booking Management
- **Model**: `Booking.cs` with:  
  `Id`, `ResourceId`, `StartTime`, `EndTime`, `BookedBy`, `Purpose`
- **Relationship**: One-to-many with `Resource` (Foreign Key)
- **Migrations**: Applied to create `Bookings` table
- **Display**: 
  - Bookings listed in a separate view
  - **Home page** shows upcoming bookings with countdown (`X hours from now`)

---

## ‚úÖ Booking Logic, UI, and Validation

### üî∏ Booking Creation Form
- Dropdown filtered to only show `IsAvailable == true` resources
- Inputs: `StartTime`, `EndTime`, `BookedBy`, `Purpose`
- Booking is **blocked** if resource is unavailable (checked server-side)

### üî∏ Conflict Detection
- Logic ensures:
  - No overlapping bookings for a resource
  - `EndTime > StartTime`
  - Booking window does not clash with another booking
- On conflict: User-friendly message shown

### üî∏ Server-side + Client-side Validation
- `[Required]`, `[StringLength]`, and datetime validation
- Enabled unobtrusive client-side validation via `_ValidationScriptsPartial.cshtml`

---

## üé® UI/UX Enhancements

- **Bootstrap 5** used throughout
- Clean, responsive layout for mobile/desktop
- `datetime-local` fields used for accurate booking time entry
- Navbar includes links to:
  - Resources
  - Bookings
  - Dashboard
- Dashboard/Home page shows:
  - Total resource count
  - Upcoming bookings
  - Action buttons

---

## üß† Code Quality & Best Practices

- Followed SOLID principles
- Used try-catch blocks to handle exceptions
- Used proper naming conventions
- Applied separation of concerns between models, views, and controllers
- Logical Git commits with meaningful messages

---

## üîê Features Not Implemented (By Design)

| Feature | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| User Authentication & Authorization | Only admin should manage resources. Planned but not implemented. |
| Role-based Access | Could restrict booking/editing to authorized users. |
| Audit Trail | Booking history/edit tracking not included. |
| Search/Filter | Filtering bookings by date/resource is not yet implemented. |
| Data Seeding | No initial data provided; could be added in future. |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

- **SDK Downgrade**: Had to uninstall EF Core tools version `9.x` and reinstall compatible `7.0.21`
- **Conflicting Dependencies**: EF Core packages defaulted to `8.0.0`, but manually managed version alignment
- **405 Errors**: Due to incorrect method signatures or routing issues in `Edit` form
- **500 Internal Errors**: From runtime mismatches and object-model view issues
- **EF Migrations**: Required several re-runs to sync model changes with database

---

## üì¶ How to Run This Project

### üß∞ Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022+ or VS Code with C# extensions
- .NET 8.0 SDK installed
- MYSQL WORKBENCH installed 

---

### üöÄ Steps to Run Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Desmonddesco/ResourceBookingSystem-main

# 2. Navigate to project folder
cd ResourceBookingSystem

# 3. Apply migrations
dotnet ef database update

# 4. Run the application

}

## üîÑ Routing & Model Binding

**Routing Example:**  
`/Bookings/Edit/5`

**Model Binding Sample:**

```csharp
[HttpPost]
